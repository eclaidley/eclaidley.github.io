                <p>This was a project for a Synthetic Biology Project Design course that I took during my undergraduate studies. We were tasked with designing a research project that utilized synthetic biology to solve a key problem; while we were not to carry out any of the laboratory work, I was able to take a concept from ideation to a fully fleshed out project proposal with minimal assistance.</p>
                <p>The final product took the form of chewing gum containing <em>Lactobacillus fermentum</em> that have been genetically engineered to express the dextranase enzyme. The dextranase enzyme would be inactive until it comes in contact with water, during the chewing process.</p>
